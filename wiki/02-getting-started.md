# Getting started

## Build the interpreter

You need a recent Rust toolchain. From the project root:

```
cargo build --release
```

This produces the `miru` binary at `target/release/miru`.

## Run a program

Put some code in a file, for example `hello.miru`:

```
print("Hello from a file!")
```

Then run it:

```
miru run hello.miru
```

## Use the REPL

Run `miru` with no arguments to start an interactive session:

```
miru
```

Type an expression and press Enter to see its value:

```
miru> 2 + 3 * 4
14
miru> let name = "Miru"
miru> "Hello, " + name
"Hello, Miru"
```

Definitions stay available for the rest of the session. To type something that
spans several lines, such as a function, just keep typing: the prompt changes to
`...` until the brackets are balanced. Press Ctrl-D to exit.
