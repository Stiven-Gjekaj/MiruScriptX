# Changelog

All notable changes to MiruScriptX are recorded here. The format is based on
Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning.

## Unreleased

Planned next: more general builtins (string, array, and math helpers, plus
`input`) and richer error messages with a column and a caret. See
`docs/milestones.md` for the full roadmap.

## 0.2 (2026-07-23)

### Added

- Maps and dictionaries: `{"key": value}` literals, reading and writing by key
  (a missing key reads as `nil`), with deterministic sorted-key ordering.
- Map builtins `keys`, `values`, and `has`; `len` now works on maps too.
- `break` and `continue` for `while` and `for` loops, rejected at parse time
  when used outside a loop.
- A `contacts.msx` example and a Maps lesson in the wiki.

## 0.1 (2026-07-22)

### Added

- Lexer, Pratt parser, and a tree-walking interpreter with zero dependencies.
- Integers, floats, booleans, strings, arrays, functions, closures, and nil.
- `let` bindings and reassignment; `if` / `else if` / `else`, `while`, and
  `for ... in`.
- Arithmetic with integer and float promotion, comparisons, and short-circuit
  logic.
- Array literals, indexing, and index assignment.
- Builtins `print`, `len`, `push`, `str`, `type`, and `range`.
- A command line runner (`miru run file.msx`) and an interactive REPL.
- Example programs, a test suite, a guided wiki, a single-page reference, and a
  CI workflow.
